    #Mood: Overwhelmed, excited, nervous
    #Notes: Worked on W11 After- Class Assignement requiremtns.  This project will be an opportunity to showcase what I've learned. I'm quite nervous because I'm overwhelmed, but I'm excited to try. I look forward to the end product being apart of my portfolio. My expectations are to do the basic to strengthen my understanding. I'm interested in understanding what I'm doing more than the visual appeal.
