✍️ Section 1: Week 11 Reflection
Answer each prompt with 3–5 bullet points:

Key Takeaways: What did you learn about capstone goals and expectations?
This project will be an opportunity to showcase what I've learned. I'm quite nervous because I'm overwhelmed, but I'm excited to try. I look forward to the end product being apart of my portfolio. My expectations are to do the basic to strengthen my understanding. I'm interested in understanding what I'm doing more than the visual appeal. 

Concept Connections: Which Week 1–10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice?
Everything from week 1-10 is squashed together at this point. The raw coding withstarter code is nerve wrecking. I can't pinpoint what is hard and where I need more practice. I'm just going to start doing it and figure that out along the way. 

Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?

Folder setup, it wasn't clear how we should set up our folders. As a class we spent a few days concerned about where to start with our folder setup. 

API Keys, we learned about API keys so long ago. I couldn't remember how to get an API key or how to set up the folders. 

Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?

🧠 Section 2: Feature Selection Rationale
List three features + one enhancement you plan to build.

#	Feature Name	Difficulty (1–3)	Why You Chose It / Learning Goal
1	Simple Statistics        1                   Familiarity with Min/max  		
2	Weather History Tracker  1              Display last 7 days		
3	Simple Statistics        1              weather type counting		
Enhancement		–	Theme Switcher-Day/night

🤝 Section 7: Support Requests
What specific help will you ask for in office hours or on Slack?

I'm not sure yet. 


✅ Section 8: Before Monday (Start of Week 12)
Complete these setup steps before Monday:

Push main.py, config.py, and a /data/ folder to your repo

Add OpenWeatherMap key to .env (⚠️ Do not commit the key)

Create files for the chosen feature in /features/ 

like this:
# weather_journal.py
"""
Feature: Weather Journal
- Stores daily mood and notes alongside weather data
"""
def add_journal_entry(date, mood, notes):
    # your code goes here
    pass
Commit and push a first-draft README.md

Book office hours if you're still stuck on API setup
